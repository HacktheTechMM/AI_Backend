       "'**Code Review**\\n\\nYour code looks clean and straightforward. Here\\'s a breakdown of what you\\'re doing:\\n\\n1. You\\'re defining a function `check_voting_eligibility` that takes no arguments.\\n2. You\\'re using a `try`-`except` block to catch any `ValueError` exceptions that might occur when trying to convert the user\\'s input to an integer.\\n3. You\\'re prompting the user to enter their age and storing it in the `age` variable.\\n4. You\\'re checking if the user\\'s age is greater than or equal to 18 and printing out a message indicating whether they\\'re eligible to vote or not.\\n\\n**Feedback**\\n\\n* Your code is well-structured and easy to read.\\n* You\\'re handling potential errors by catching `ValueError` exceptions.\\n* Your function name is descriptive and indicates what the function does.\\n\\n**Suggestions**\\n\\n* Consider adding a docstring to your function to describe what it does, what inputs it expects, and what outputs it produces.\\n* You might want to consider adding a loop to allow the user to try again if they enter an invalid input (e.g., a string instead of a number).\\n* You could also consider adding a more informative error message when the user enters an invalid input.\\n\\n**Updated Code**\\n\\n```python\\ndef check_voting_eligibility():\\n \"\"\"\\n Checks if a user is eligible to vote based on their age.\\n\\n Prompts the user to enter their age and prints out a message indicating\\n whether they\\'re eligible to vote or not.\\n \"\"\"\\n while True:\\n try:\\n age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\\n if age >= 18:\\n print(\"You are eligible to vote.\")\\n else:\\n print(\"You are not eligible to vote yet.\")\\n break\\n except ValueError:\\n print(\"Please enter a valid number for age.\")\\n\\ncheck_voting_eligibility()\\n```\\n\\n**Goodbye!**'"

       "'**Code Review**\\n\\nYour code looks great for a beginner! Here\\'s a step-by-step review:\\n\\n### Logic\\n\\n1. You\\'re taking two numbers as input from the user using `input()` and converting them to integers using `int()`. This is correct!\\n2. You\\'re storing the inputs in variables `a` and `b`, which is a good practice.\\n3. You\\'re calculating the sum of `a` and `b` using the `+` operator, which is correct.\\n4. You\\'re printing the result using `print()`, which is correct.\\n\\n### Code Quality\\n\\n* Your code is concise and easy to read.\\n* You\\'re using meaningful variable names (`a` and `b` could be more descriptive, but it\\'s okay for a beginner).\\n* You\\'re handling the input conversion to integers correctly.\\n\\n### Suggestions for Improvement\\n\\n* Consider adding a prompt to inform the user what the output represents (e.g., \"The sum is:\").\\n* You could use more descriptive variable names, such as `num1` and `num2`.\\n* You might want to add some error handling to handle cases where the user enters something that can\\'t be converted to an integer.\\n\\n### Updated Code\\n\\nHere\\'s an updated version of your code with some minor improvements:\\n```python\\nnum1 = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\\nnum2 = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\\nprint(f\"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is: {num1 + num2}\")\\n```\\n**Overall**\\n\\nGreat job on completing the task! Keep practicing, and you\\'ll become a proficient programmer in no time. Remember to always think about error handling and code readability.\\n\\n**Next Steps**\\n\\nTry to modify your code to:\\n\\n* Handle cases where the user enters something that can\\'t be converted to an integer.\\n* Ask the user if they want to perform another calculation.\\n\\nI\\'ll be here to help you with any questions or code reviews!'"
